#Dogwood

A primitive, work-in-progress game engine in OpenGL.


###Model Loading

The engine currently supports OBJ models only.

To create a compatible model in Blender, select exactly these export options:
> * Apply Modifiers
* Include Normals
* Include UVs
* Triangulate Faces
* Objects as OBJ Objects

To get smooth shading, select "Smooth" before export.
