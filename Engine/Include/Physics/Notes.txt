Collision
---------

- Track all collidable entities in singleton "collision world"
- Collidable entity needs *shape* and *transform*
- "Contact" struct should include:
    - the 2 collidables that intersected
    - separating vector
    - velocity?
- Collision primitives:
    - Sphere (center and radius)
    - Capsule (two points and radius)
    - AABB (min and max points)
    - OBB (half-width, half-depth, half-height, transform)


Rigid Body Dynamics
-------------------

  - Motion type: fixed (e.g. staic geo), game-driven, or physics-driven

  Design choices: Rigid body, iterative, impulse-based
    - Object type: Mass aggregate with rotation
    - Contact resolution: Iterative
    - Impulses vs. Forces: Impulse based
