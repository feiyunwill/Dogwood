    * Audio
    * Networking
    * Memory allocators

    * Shading
        * Multiple light sources?
    * Transform math helpers

    * Debugging
        * Debug logging (with streams)
        * Tweakables?

    * Fix-up stuff
        * Memory leaks everywhere! Lots of missing "deletes"
        * Colour -> Color everywhere for consistency
        * Rewrite matrix inversion. Currently just copied from CS488 provided code
        * Add missing matrix maths (e.g. addition)
        * Input wrappers
            * Configurable gamepad setup
            * #define to compile without XInput?
        * Re-factor MainEditorWindow.cpp
        * typedef guid type?
        * Remove un-used guids on scene serialization

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDITOR (Thicket)

    * Project
        * Project settings window
        * Prompt for save on exit/unload
        * Remove assets (un-import)
        * Save/load scene list
        * Automatically rebuild shader info on shader import

    * Scene
        * Prompt for save on exit/unload
        * Camera settings
        * Light settings
        * Picking: raycast against actual meshes instead of bounding boxes

    * Game components
        * Built-in component widgets
            * Transform: expand x/y/z as separate rows
            * Mesh/Texture/Shader: add browse
        * Remove components
            * Undo/redo on add/remove
            * Refresh widget on add/remove
        * Enable/disable components
        * General
            - Show bool values as check boxes
            - Set data using EditorCommands for undo/redo everywhere
            - Better value validation
            - Fixup background color code
            - For reference types, show full asset path on hover (Scripts)
            - Reference type params should be styled differently (font color?)
            - Fix occasioanl null refs after model delete & rebuild

    * Visuals
        * Change transform tool shape based on mode
        * Use cones instead of pyramids for gnomon arrows

    * Object manipulation
        * Local vs. Global option
    
    * Window resizing

    * "Prefabs"?

    BUGS:
        Lo pri
        - Items don't auto expand when reparented
        - Scene view resolution isn't set nicely
        - Keep constant gnomon size
        - Rotation tool behaviour is non-intuitive
        - Saving project should write asset list in consistent order
        - Fix GameObject child removal
        - Refresh widgets on schema rebuild

        Hi pri
        - Undo/redo broken with delete/undo create. Need to avoid use of QModelIndex
        - Non-uniform scaling breaks object picking

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESIGN DECISIONS

    Matrices are row major

    Right handed coordinate system
        - Most OpenGL tutorial are right handed

    Scene files
     - Format: XML
        - Mergeable/diffable
        - Human readable
        - Human writeable (before tool is ready)

    Editor
    - Start early! Build in lockstep with Engine features
    - Put Engine code in separate project that builds static lib
        - Linked to Game exe and Editor exe

    Windowing/UI Library
    - QT for Editor but GLFW for game
        - QT needed for UI for Editor, but can't control game loop as easily, slower
        - Can build game without Qt dependency

    Undo/redo 
    - Added undo stack right after first editor commands were implemented (create and delete)
    - Would be extremely painful to add in later after lots of commands were implemented

    Error checking in Editor
    - Make some assumptions about user choices for simplicity

    Reworking shader asset
    - Initially shaders were a weird special case of asset with two source files (vert shader and frag shader)
    - This cause a lot of ugly special case code all over the place
    - Eventually changed it so that a shader is just one file, with annotation separating vert part from frag part
    - Wish I had done the change sooner, had to change project and scene files by hand to fix it

    Do cleanup / deletion code right away
    - Leaving it as a TODO means it probably won't get done
