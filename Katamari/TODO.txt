First pass basic features:
    * Scene graph
    * Model loading

    * Particles
    * Shadows

Second pass basic features:
    * Multiple light sources?

Big systems:
    * Physics
    * Animation
    * Lua scripting

Debugging stuff:
    * Debug logging (with streams)
    * Debug draw
    * Tweakables?

Fix-up stuff
    * Engine needs a name!
    * Rewrite matrix inversion. Currently just copied from CS488 provided code
    * Add missing matrix maths (e.g. addition)

Things to understand better:
    - which calculations are done in vertex vs. fragment shader
